**Django Celery** refers to the integration of Celery with Django, a popular Python web framework. Celery is used in Django projects to handle background tasks, allowing you to offload long-running processes like sending emails, generating reports, processing files, or any other task that doesn't need to block the main request-response cycle.

### Why Use Celery with Django?
- **Asynchronous Task Execution**: Celery allows tasks to run asynchronously, freeing up Django to handle other requests.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: You can schedule periodic tasks, similar to cron jobs.
- **Scalability**: Celery can distribute tasks across multiple workers or machines, making your application more scalable.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Celery can automatically retry tasks if they fail due to transient issues.

### Setting Up Celery with Django

Here's a step-by-step guide to integrating Celery with Django:

#### 1. **Install Celery**
You can install Celery using pip:

```bash
pip install celery
```

If you're using Redis as a message broker, install the Redis package as well:

```bash
pip install redis
```

#### 2. **Create a Celery Instance in Django**
In your Django project, create a new file named `celery.py` in the same directory as `settings.py`. This file will configure Celery and link it with your Django project.

```python
# myproject/celery.py

from __future__ import absolute_import, unicode_literals
import os
from celery import Celery

# Set the default Django settings module for the 'celery' program.
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myproject.settings')

app = Celery('myproject')

# Using a string here means the worker doesn't have to serialize
# the configuration object to child processes.
# - namespace='CELERY' means all celery-related configuration keys
#   should have a `CELERY_` prefix.
app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')

# Load task modules from all registered Django app configs.
app.autodiscover_tasks()

@app.task(bind=True)
def debug_task(self):
    print(f'Request: {self.request!r}')
```

#### 3. **Configure Celery in Django Settings**
Add Celery configurations to your `settings.py` file:

```python
# myproject/settings.py

# Celery settings
CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'  # Using Redis as the broker
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'  # Store results in Redis
CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['json']
CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'
CELERY_TIMEZONE = 'UTC'
```

#### 4. **Create Tasks in Django Apps**
In your Django app, you can create a `tasks.py` file to define your Celery tasks.

```python
# myapp/tasks.py

from celery import shared_task
from time import sleep

@shared_task
def add(x, y):
    sleep(10)  # Simulate a long-running task
    return x + y
```

The `@shared_task` decorator lets Celery know that this function is a task.

#### 5. **Call Tasks in Django Views or Models**
You can call Celery tasks asynchronously from your Django views, models, or any other part of your code:

```python
# myapp/views.py

from django.http import JsonResponse
from .tasks import add

def some_view(request):
    result = add.delay(4, 6)  # Call the task asynchronously
    return JsonResponse({'task_id': result.id})
```

#### 6. **Run Celery Workers**
To start processing tasks, run the Celery worker from the command line:

```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info
```

This command starts the Celery worker process, which listens for tasks in the queue and executes them.

#### 7. **Monitoring Tasks**
You can monitor the status of tasks and manage your Celery workers using tools like Flower, a real-time web-based monitor for Celery.

```bash
pip install flower
celery -A myproject flower
```

### Example: Sending Emails Asynchronously
Let's say you want to send emails asynchronously in your Django app using Celery:

1. **Define the Task**:

   ```python
   # myapp/tasks.py

   from celery import shared_task
   from django.core.mail import send_mail

   @shared_task
   def send_welcome_email(user_email):
       send_mail(
           'Welcome!',
           'Thank you for signing up.',
           'from@example.com',
           [user_email],
           fail_silently=False,
       )
   ```

2. **Call the Task**:

   ```python
   # myapp/views.py

   from .tasks import send_welcome_email

   def signup_view(request):
       # (Signup logic here...)
       send_welcome_email.delay(user.email)  # Send email asynchronously
       return JsonResponse({'status': 'Signup successful!'})
   ```

In this example, `send_welcome_email` will be executed in the background, so the user doesnâ€™t have to wait for the email to be sent before receiving a response from the server.

### Conclusion
Django Celery is a powerful combination for building scalable and efficient web applications. By integrating Celery with Django, you can handle asynchronous tasks, schedule jobs, and manage background processes with ease, making your Django application more responsive and scalable.
