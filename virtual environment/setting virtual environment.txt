pip install virtualenv

1) virtualenv env   (create a new born environment )

   virtualenv --system-site-packages env2 (create environment with all the packages installed in the outer environment in python )


2) set-executionpolicy unrestricted   (in admin mode of powershell)


3) .\env\Scripts\activate.ps1

{

	for activating using Git bash:
	On Windows10, you could go in the directory of your virtualenv where the Scripts folder is placed then enter the below command

	source ./Scripts/activate

}


4) 

{

 pip install flask
 pip install gunicorn      (for making req.txt file)


 python run.py

}

{

	Better way of runing Flask  is to run by setting environment variable  on git bash terminal:  
	(https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/       # see this for using on diff plateforms )

	export FLASK_APP=run.py       (don't use space with =)
	export FLASK_ENV=development
	flask run   			(  this will execute your run.py file )

}

{
	On powershell :

       set FLASK_APP=run.py
       set FLASK_ENV=development
       flask run
}



5) pip freeze > requirement.txt   (make requirements.txt file)
6) pip install -r .\requirements.txt    (install all modules in the requirements.txt )


deactivate
