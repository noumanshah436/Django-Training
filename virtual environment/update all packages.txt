Python Package Upgrade Checklist
In general, you can use the following steps to perform a package upgrade:

1. Check that Python is installed

Before packages can be updated, ensure that a Python installation containing the necessary files needed for updating packages is in place by following the steps outlined in <Installation Requirements>

2. Get a list of all the outdated packages

To generate a list of all outdated packages:

pip list --outdated

3. Upgrade outdated packages

Update All Python Packages On Windows

The easiest way to update all packages in a Windows environment is to use pip in conjunction with Windows PowerShell: 

Open a command shell by typing ‘powershell’ in the Search Box of the Task bar
Enter:
pip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}
This will upgrade all packages system-wide to the latest version available in the Python Package Index (PyPI).

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
