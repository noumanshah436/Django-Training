The class Meta inside a Django model allows you to define various options and configurations for that model. 
Here are some common use cases for the Meta class:

Custom Table Name: You can specify a custom name for the database table associated with the model using the db_table option:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    db_table = "custom_table_name"
Verbose Name: You can provide a human-readable name for the model class using the verbose_name option:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    verbose_name = "Human-readable Name"
Verbose Name Plural: Similar to verbose_name, you can define a plural name for the model using verbose_name_plural:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    verbose_name_plural = "Human-readable Plural Name"
Unique Constraints: You can define unique constraints on fields using the unique_together option:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    unique_together = ("field1", "field2")
Indexing: You can specify custom indexes on fields using the indexes option:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    indexes = [
        models.Index(fields=["field1"]),
        models.Index(fields=["field2", "field3"]),
    ]
Permissions: You can set default permissions for the model using the permissions option:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    permissions = [
        ("can_view_details", "Can view details"),
        ("can_change_settings", "Can change settings"),
    ]
Abstract Models: If you're creating an abstract base model, you can indicate that by setting abstract = True:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    abstract = True
App Label: You can provide a custom app label to group models in the admin interface using the app_label option:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    app_label = "CustomAppLabel"
Proxy Models: For proxy models, you can set proxy = True:

python
Copy code
class Meta:
    proxy = True
Default Ordering: As you mentioned earlier, you can set the default ordering for model instances using the ordering option.

These are just a few examples of what you can do with the class Meta inside a Django model. The Meta class provides a way to configure various aspects of your model's behavior, presentation, and interactions with the database and admin interface.
