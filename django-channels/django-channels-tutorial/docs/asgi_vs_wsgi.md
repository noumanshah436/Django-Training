**ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)** is designed for handling asynchronous tasks like WebSockets, long-lived connections, and asynchronous HTTP requests. It allows for real-time communication and scalability, making it suitable for modern applications.

**WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)** is synchronous, designed to handle standard HTTP requests. It works well for traditional web apps but does not support long-lived connections or asynchronous operations.

In summary, ASGI is more flexible and suited for handling modern, real-time web applications, while WSGI is limited to simpler, synchronous HTTP applications.
