reverse and reverse_lazy are both functions provided by Django to generate URLs for named views,
but they have different use cases and behaviors.

reverse:

Eager Evaluation:
The reverse function generates the URL immediately when called.
It's useful when you're working with synchronous code and can immediately generate the URL.

Usage:
You can use reverse in situations where the URL generation won't cause any issues with circular imports.

For example, in views, templates, and other places where the URL is generated directly.
Example:

from django.urls import reverse
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def my_view(request):
    return redirect(reverse('my_app:my_view_name'))


we can also test this in terminal:

>>> from django.urls import reverse
>>> reverse("polls:results", args=(3,))
'/polls/3/results/'

Another Example:

In Urlconfig
path('products/<int:id>/', my_view_function, name='product-detail')

In product model:
def get_absolute_url(self):
    return reverse('product-detail', kwargs={'id': self.id})

**********************

reverse_lazy:

Lazy Evaluation:
The reverse_lazy function returns a lazy object that doesn't immediately generate the URL.
It's particularly useful in situations where there could be circular import problems,
 such as when using class-based views or other scenarios where the URL generation is deferred until it's actually needed.

Usage:
You should use reverse_lazy in situations where the URL generation is delayed,
such as in class attributes or any situation where the URL might be accessed before the URL configuration is fully loaded.

Example:

from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views.generic import RedirectView

class MyRedirectView(RedirectView):
    url = reverse_lazy('my_app:my_view_name')


we can also test this in terminal:

>>> from django.urls import reverse_lazy
>>> reverse_lazy('bookshelf:my_books')
'/bookshelf/my-books/'


***************************


In summary:

Use reverse when you're working with synchronous code and there are no concerns about circular imports or other delayed URL resolution issues.
Use reverse_lazy when you need to generate a URL in a context that could lead to circular imports or if you're using class-based views.
By using the appropriate function based on your scenario, you can avoid potential issues and ensure that your URL generation behaves as expected.
