 It is quite easy to understand in comparison to class-based views.

It is easy to understand and easy to use.

Class-based views can be used in place of function-based views.

They provide some excellent example over the function-based views.
Class-based views can implement CRUD operation in easy manner.

It follows the DRY convention of Django.
We can extend class-based views and can add more functionality according to a requirement using Mixin.
