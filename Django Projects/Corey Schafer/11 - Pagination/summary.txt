we just see paggination commnads in cmd

add paginate_by = 5 in class based view

add links to other pages in home.html file

***********************************


for user views :

we make a new UserPostListView and make our custom query set to get all post of that user.

we make template for this view and copy home.html in it and make some changes in it.


At last we add proper links on the user to work correctly
