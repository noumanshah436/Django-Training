Application server vs Web server


### **Web Server**
- **Purpose**: A web server primarily handles HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and delivers static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. It may also process dynamic content if it's set up with server-side scripting or CGI (Common Gateway Interface).
- **Key Functions**:
  - Serves static files (e.g., HTML, images).
  - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
  - Can delegate dynamic content requests to application servers or backend services (e.g., using CGI or PHP).
  - May support SSL/TLS encryption for secure communications (HTTPS).
- **Examples**:
  - Apache HTTP Server
  - Nginx
  - Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services)

### **Application Server**
- **Purpose**: An application server is designed to host and execute application code, typically for dynamic web applications. It often works with a web server to process and serve content, but it focuses on running the business logic and handling dynamic content requests (e.g., generating HTML dynamically, handling database connections).
- **Key Functions**:
  - Executes dynamic application logic (e.g., Java, Python, Ruby).
  - Interacts with databases and external services.
  - Can generate dynamic content (e.g., rendering HTML, processing business logic).
  - Typically includes middleware services like transaction management, security, and message handling.
- **Examples**:
  - **Java EE Application Servers**: JBoss, GlassFish, WebLogic
  - **Python Application Servers**: Gunicorn, uWSGI
  - **Node.js Servers**: Express.js (in the context of an application server)

### **Key Differences**:
1. **Primary Role**:
   - A **web server** is focused on handling HTTP requests and serving static content.
   - An **application server** handles the dynamic processing of business logic and often interacts with databases or backend services.

2. **Content Served**:
   - Web servers handle **static content** (e.g., images, HTML, CSS).
   - Application servers handle **dynamic content** (e.g., rendering HTML, processing business logic).

3. **Interaction with Web Servers**:
   - A **web server** can directly serve static content and pass dynamic requests to an application server.
   - An **application server** processes dynamic content and may not directly handle HTTP requests but can interact with a web server.

In many modern architectures, **web servers** and **application servers** work together to handle both static and dynamic content for web applications.

### Django web framework

Actually, **Django**  is a **web framework** for building web applications in Python. The confusion can arise because Django has a **built-in development server** that you can use to run your app locally while you're developing, but that server is **not intended for production** use.

### Here's the clarification:
1. **Django** is a **web framework**:
   - It provides tools to build dynamic websites and web applications.
   - It handles the business logic, URL routing, database interactions, and rendering dynamic HTML pages.
   - Django follows the **WSGI** (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard, meaning it's designed to work with WSGI-compliant servers (like **Gunicorn**) in production.

2. **Django’s Built-in Development Server**:
   - While developing, you can use the built-in development server by running `python manage.py runserver`.
   - This server is very simple and not optimized for handling production traffic or scaling.
   - It is good for local development and testing, but **not** suitable for real-world deployment.

3. **Web Servers**:
   - A **web server** like **Nginx** or **Apache** is designed to handle incoming HTTP requests, serve static files, and forward requests for dynamic content to an application server like **Gunicorn** (which is running your Django application).
   - Web servers are optimized for serving content at scale, handling HTTP traffic, managing connections, and other important tasks.

---

### Summary:
- **Django** is a web framework, not a web server.
- **Gunicorn** (a WSGI server) is the actual server running your Django application.
- **Nginx** or **Apache** is the web server that handles HTTP traffic and serves static content, and forwards requests for dynamic content to Gunicorn/Django.

In production, you typically use **Nginx** or **Apache** as the web server, and **Gunicorn** as the application server to run Django.

### Web Server vs WSGI Server

**Gunicorn** is a **WSGI server** (Web Server Gateway Interface server). Gunicorn's role is to serve Python web applications, like Django, while a **web server** (like **Nginx** or **Apache**) handles HTTP requests and static content.


### Key Differences:
1. **Web Server (like Nginx or Apache)**:
   - Primarily handles HTTP requests and responses.
   - Serves **static content** (images, CSS, JavaScript).
   - Can act as a **reverse proxy**, forwarding requests for dynamic content to application servers like Gunicorn.
   - Manages aspects like load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing.

2. **WSGI Server (like Gunicorn)**:
   - **WSGI** (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a specification that defines how web servers and Python web applications (like Django) communicate.
   - **Gunicorn** is a WSGI server that **runs Python web applications**. It accepts requests forwarded by a web server and passes them to the Django application for processing.
   - It doesn't serve static files, handle HTTP headers, or manage things like SSL. It simply **executes the application code** (e.g., Django's views and business logic) and returns a response.

---

### How They Work Together:
- **Nginx** (or Apache) is the **web server** that handles the HTTP request and serves static content.
- If a request is for dynamic content (like a Django view), Nginx forwards it to **Gunicorn**, which runs your Django application and returns the response.
- Gunicorn is responsible for **processing Python code**, while Nginx is responsible for **handling HTTP requests** and static assets.

---

### Summary:
- **Gunicorn** is a **WSGI server**, not a web server.
- **Gunicorn** runs Python applications (like Django) and serves dynamic content, but relies on a **web server** (like **Nginx** or **Apache**) to handle HTTP traffic and serve static content.
